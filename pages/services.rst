Hi,
I am Francesco Pischedda, nice to meet you!
I am a software developer and I am here to help you to grow your IT
infrastructure in order to support your very own business; so what can I do for
you in practice? Let's see the services I'm offering:

Software development
====================
Currently I spend a lot of time doing full stack web development with python
and the django framework; my skills are not restricted to the python world
in fact I have several pieces of my code running in the wild written with ruby,
c#, go, php, c, c++, java.

My skills can be put at work in these areas:

- web development
- game development
- servers and services
- desktop and mobile applications
- integration with third party softwares

Training
========
Right now I can teach you or someone of your IT team each of this arguments:

- computer and software architecture
- generic programming concepts
- c, c++, python, ruby, go, c#, php, javascript, html from beginner to
  intermediate level
- programming frameworks
- introduction to shell and its tools for example vim, git, tmux and so on

These arguments are only the tip of the iceberg, if you need to learn something
not listed here dont' be sad, there are chances that I can help you anyway. 

Software auditing and evaluation
================================
The team you have hired have just released the product you have paid for but
you are not sure about quality and/or security of their job?
Do you want to add some software in your infrastructure but you don't have the
time or the skills to know if it is a good fit for your organization?
Do you want to port old legacy code to a new language/platform?
I am here to help!

Project management
==================
Do you need help coordinating a new team you have hired? Probably you want to
focus on your own business activity and sleep at night knowing that there is
someone that is coordinating your IT team to get the job done as good and quick
as possible.

Graphics/Web design, illustrations, artwork
===========================================

Well, this is not my job and I am really terrible at it but I have the
possibility to get help from very qualified and skilled professionals.
