Hi,
I am Francesco, nice to meet you!

I am a software developer and **I am here to help you** to grow your IT
infrastructure in order **to support your business**.
Please contact me at francesco.pischedda at gmail.com and I will send you
an invite for a meeting to discuss how I can help you.

Let's have a look at the services I can offer:

Software development
--------------------

I spend a lot of time doing full stack web development with Python,
Clojure, ClojureScript and soon Elixir and Golang.
My experience is not restricted to the mentioned languages, in fact I have
several pieces of my code running in the wild written with Javascript, Ruby,
C, C++, C#, Golang, PHP, Java; I just need to restart those brain cells and
I will be ready to help you with your project.

My skills can be applied in these areas:

- web development
- game development
- servers and services
- desktop and mobile applications
- integration with third party softwares

I have no strict preference for a specific business domain but I will NOT work on:

- Gambling and betting
- Weapons, army, surveillance and law enforcement

If you need to take care of your legacy system, break down a monolith to a set of
micro services or start a green field project to validate your startup hypothesis,
I will be happy help you! Please, feel free to contact me at francesco.pischedda at gmail.com

Training
--------

I can assist you or someone of your team in the process of learning a new
language, framework or library.
I can cover the following topics:

- Computer and software architecture
- Software programming concepts
- Programming languages: C, C++, Python, Clojure, Ruby, Golang, C#, PHP,
  Javascript from beginner to intermediate level

These arguments are only the tip of the iceberg, if you need to learn something
not listed here dont' worry, there are chances that I can help you anyway.
